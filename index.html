            <!-- Ditto about marketing here.-->
            <p>According to the EPA, “Vernal pools are seasonal depressional wetlands that occur under the Mediterranean climate conditions of the West Coast.” <br> <br> In San Diego, these vernal pools exist in the form of rock and dirt basins that collect rainwater to make temporary pools of water that provide for complex chaparral ecosystems of wood frogs, salamanders, snakes, bacteria, protists, algae, wading birds, protozoa, and endangered fairy shrimp. <br><br>Vernal pool ecosystems in southern California have long suffered destruction by human interference and shorter wet seasons, both of which have shifted fairy shrimp to classification as a threatened species.</p>

             shrimp section, which isn't how it's formatted in the research
             Google doc. The content seems to flow better this way. -->

            <h1>Fairy shrimp — small, but important</h1>
            <!-- TODO: Come up with a less cliché header -->
            <p>Fairy shrimp are tiny, translucent invertebrates that reside in vernal pools. The fairy shrimp’s short life cycle, structured to endure no natural predators, is extremely important to its ecosystem. Fairy shrimp lay eggs in late April, which lie dormant once the pool dries up. Then, once the pools fill up again with seasonal November rains, the cycle begins again. <br><br>However, perhaps the most important aspect of fairy shirmp are their detoxification abilities. </p>
