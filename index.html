            <p>According to the EPA, “Vernal pools are seasonal depressional wetlands that occur under the Mediterranean climate conditions of the West Coast.” <br> <br> In San Diego, these vernal pools exist in the form of rock and dirt basins that collect rainwater to make temporary pools of water that provide for complex chaparral ecosystems of wood frogs, salamanders, snakes, bacteria, protists, algae, wading birds, protozoa, and endangered fairy shrimp. <br><br>Vernal pool ecosystems in southern California have long suffered destruction by human interference and shorter wet seasons, both of which have shifted fairy shrimp to classification as a threatened species. Housing an endangered species, and providing for an entire ecosystem, San Diego's vernal pools are important to protect.</p>

            <p>Vernal pools support a multitude of species, while also preventing flooding from wiping out other plants that are unable to thrive from such periods, and hosting plants that cannot survive the dry period that follows. The gathering of the water in the pools also attracts amphibious species that often breed and thrive in the area. <br> <br>Due to the high amounts of invertebrates found in vernal pools, they also become a temporary habitat for migrating birds, serving as a source of food and water for birds such as ducks, herons, egrets, and many more.<br><br>The easiest to spot are Pacific Chorus Frog tadpoles. In early spring, you'll see little black spots wriggling around in the pools. These tadpoles and frogs are one of the most direct contributors to the chaparall food chain and ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Fairy shrimp are tiny, translucent invertebrates that reside in vernal pools. The fairy shrimp’s short life cycle, structured to endure no natural predators, is extremely important to its ecosystem. Fairy shrimp lay eggs in late April, which lie dormant once the pool dries up. Then, once the pools fill up again with seasonal November rains, the cycle begins again. <br><br>However, perhaps the most important aspect of fairy shirmp are their detoxification abilities. They consume algae, bacteria, and protozoa that are harmful to other organisms in the pools. Even though fairy shrimp have no natural predators, the entire chaparral ecosystem is dependent on the vernal pools that fairy shrimp keep clean. </p>

            <p>Vernal pools, and the organisms they house, are essential to the chaparral ecosystem in San Diego. However, up to 90% of vernal pools have been destroyed, so it is necessary that we protect the ones that remain. You can help by staying on trails, not taking shortcuts or jumping fences, avoiding trails during and after rain, and keeping your pets on trail.<br><br>Remember, even though the pools may look dry, hiking, biking, horse riding, and allowing pets to walk through them can cause damage.<br><br></p>
            <!-- TODO: Add complete tect. I noticed that in the research document, this section basically restates everything in the general vernal pools section, so you might want to review that before pasting it in here. -->
